These wondrous works of magic and morality enthralled us, enchanted us, sometimes terrified us, and remain in our hearts and memories still. Once again, World Fantasy Award–winning editors Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling have compiled an extraordinary collection of reimagined tales conceived by some of today’s most acclaimed contemporary purveyors of literary fantasy, science fiction, and horror, including Neil Gaiman, Gahan Wilson, Joyce Carol Oates, Tanith Lee, Nancy Kress, Gene Wolfe, and others.Remarkable things lurk in these dark and magical woods. Here Beauty confronts a serial-killer Beast, Hansel and Gretel’s witch resides not in a gingerbread house but in a luxurious resort, and Rumpelstiltskin is truly the devil demanding his due, rightfully or otherwise. The hilarious “Roach in Loafers” ingeniously combines the classic “Elves and the Shoemaker” tale with “Puss in Boots” and adds an insectile twist, while in a modern fable that blends The Wizard of Oz and Hans Christian Andersen, Dorothy is set adrift in Hollywoodland, ruby slippers and all. These are not the fairy stories you remember from childhood.","itemPrice":656,"itemUrl":"http://books.rakuten.co.jp/rk/2c36e61671d138c49696f35fc49d1067","affiliateUrl":"","smallImageUrl":"http://thumbnail.image.rakuten.co.jp/@0_gold/rakutenkobo-ebooks/imghb/de/ff/2c36e61671d138c49696f35fc49d1067.jpg?_ex=64x64","mediumImageUrl":"http://thumbnail.image.rakuten.co.jp/@0_gold/rakutenkobo-ebooks/imghb/de/ff/2c36e61671d138c49696f35fc49d1067.jpg?_ex=120x120","largeImageUrl":"http://thumbnail.image.rakuten.co.jp/@0_gold/rakutenkobo-ebooks/imghb/de/ff/2c36e61671d138c49696f35fc49d1067.jpg?_ex=200x200","reviewCount":0,"reviewAverage":"0.0"}},{"Item":{"title":"A Sharon Creech Quartet","titleKana":"","subTitle":"Walk Two Moons, Ruby Holler, The Great Unexpected, The Boy on the Porch","seriesName":"","author":"Sharon Creech","authorKana":"","publisherName":"HarperCollins","language":"EN","salesDate":"2014年10月28日","itemNumber":"9780062375940","koboGenreId":"101970015001","itemCaption":"Newbery and Carnegie Medal-winning author Sharon Creech's stories become instant classics, beloved for their genuine characters and celebration of classic themes such as the gifts of love, family, and forgiveness.

For a single woman to succeed in this environment she required an extra measure of smarts, spunk and sometimes straight-shooting. Ruby had all these attributes in addition to being outspoken and a nonconformist.Ruby married her father’s hired man, who was afflicted with a drinking problem and a vacant libido. One swing with a castiron skilled made her a virgin widow.With only an eighth grade education she became a country school-marm and sparked a legend for parting the hair of an unruly student with a pistol bullet. Later she sent a scam artist packing when she blew away his contract through a cloud of cigar smoke.While managing a commercial warehouse, Ruby became an attorney and proved her mantle as a trial lawyer when she proved a friend innocent of murder and sent a crooked town marshal to the gallows.On her way to San Francisco, during a short layover in Portland, she became a complete woman in the arms of a man more interested in his career than becoming a husband. Aboard ship she learned the fine art of poker and later put this skill to use collecting inside business information.Arriving in San Francisco Ruby found disappointment in a man she thought a friend. Using information gleaned while playing poker she and a former cab driver successfully carried out a sting operation on a greedy San Francisco businessman by sabotaging his planned lumber monopoly and setting off a wine war.Ruby retired to a Sonoma Valley estate she purchased during the wine war, spent her time traveling and being a hobby vintner.","itemPrice":415,"itemUrl":"http://books.rakuten.co.jp/rk/9b8cbb0d06473c4cba402bda19204a70","affiliateUrl":"","smallImageUrl":"http://thumbnail.image.rakuten.co.jp/@0_gold/rakutenkobo-ebooks/imghb/23/b8/9b8cbb0d06473c4cba402bda19204a70.jpg?_ex=64x64","mediumImageUrl":"http://thumbnail.image.rakuten.co.jp/@0_gold/rakutenkobo-ebooks/imghb/23/b8/9b8cbb0d06473c4cba402bda19204a70.jpg?_ex=120x120","largeImageUrl":"http://thumbnail.image.rakuten.co.jp/@0_gold/rakutenkobo-ebooks/imghb/23/b8/9b8cbb0d06473c4cba402bda19204a70.jpg?_ex=200x200","reviewCount":0,"reviewAverage":"0.0"}},{"Item":{"title":"実践Ruby on Rails 4 機能拡張編","titleKana":"ジッセンルビーオンレイルズフォーキノウカクチョウヘン","subTitle":"","seriesName":"","author":"黒田 努","authorKana":"クロダ ツトム","publisherName":"インプレス","language":"JA","salesDate":"2014年08月25日","itemNumber":"4694844336030","koboGenreId":"101912005001","itemCaption":"本書は、2014年5月発売の書籍『実践Ruby on Rails 4 現場のプロから学ぶ本格Webプログラミング』のために書かれた原稿のうち、紙面の都合で掲載できなかった部分を集めたものです。機能拡張編単独で読まれる読者のために冒頭でサンプルアプリケーションの全体像を解説していますが、『実践Ruby on Rails 4 現場のプロから学ぶ本格Webプログラミング』とセットでご覧いただくとより理解が深まる内容になっています。Ruby on Railsの実践的な学習書であり、1つの企業向け顧客管理システムを作る中でRailsによるWebアプリケーション開発の基礎知識とさまざまなノウハウを習得していきます。各章末には演習問題が設けられているので、理解度を確かめながら確実に読み進められます。","itemPrice":2400,"itemUrl":"http://books.rakuten.co.jp/rk/9d47f5566713377fb146a144a19a64bd","affiliateUrl":"","smallImageUrl":"http://thumbnail.image.rakuten.co.jp/@0_gold/rakutenkobo-ebooks/imghb/6c/d2/9d47f5566713377fb146a144a19a64bd.png?_ex=64x64","mediumImageUrl":"http://thumbnail.image.rakuten.co.jp/@0_gold/rakutenkobo-ebooks/imghb/6c/d2/9d47f5566713377fb146a144a19a64bd.png?_ex=120x120","largeImageUrl":"http://thumbnail.image.rakuten.co.jp/@0_gold/rakutenkobo-ebooks/imghb/6c/d2/9d47f5566713377fb146a144a19a64bd.png?_ex=200x200","reviewCount":0,"reviewAverage":"0.0"}},{"Item":{"title":"Ruby Between the Cracks","titleKana":"","subTitle":"","seriesName":"Between the Cracks","author":"P.D.

という表現力豊かなプログラミング言語と出合ったからこそ、できることかもしれない。ややこしいお膳立てをあまりすることなく、割とストレートにやりたいことを書ける。多くの方をこの素晴らしい世界にお誘いしたくて、「プログラミング言語 Ruby を学びながらトレーディングシステム検証ソフトを作る」というテーマで本書を書いた。本書の内容とは、以下のとおり。    CUI    株価データのダウンロード    日本株での売買ルール検証    1銘柄ごと、1売買単位でのシミュレーション    寄り付き、ザラ場、大引けでの仕掛け、手仕舞い    売買ルールの部品化、着脱    「移動平均乖離率システム」と「ブレイクアウトシステム」のプログラム化 さあ、あなたも、株で金持ちになってみませんか。","itemPrice":1800,"itemUrl":"http://books.rakuten.co.jp/rk/081364e221163aeaba55e9738ab28653","affiliateUrl":"","smallImageUrl":"http://thumbnail.image.rakuten.co.jp/@0_gold/rakutenkobo-ebooks/imghb/bf/2f/081364e221163aeaba55e9738ab28653.png?_ex=64x64","mediumImageUrl":"http://thumbnail.image.rakuten.co.jp/@0_gold/rakutenkobo-ebooks/imghb/bf/2f/081364e221163aeaba55e9738ab28653.png?_ex=120x120","largeImageUrl":"http://thumbnail.image.rakuten.co.jp/@0_gold/rakutenkobo-ebooks/imghb/bf/2f/081364e221163aeaba55e9738ab28653.png?_ex=200x200","reviewCount":0,"reviewAverage":"0.0"}}],"GenreInformation":[]}
